  ## Description
  This application takes user input to generate a simple SVG logo. The motivation behind developing this application was to implement newly learned Node.js techniques and modules. It is a basic logo maker that takes 4 user inputs. An application of this nature could be developed further to be an adequate logo maker that provides a shortcut for making attractive, personalized logos.<br>
  <br>
  The application is run in Node.js using Inquirer.js for the user prompt interface. Jest is used as the testing framework. There are no HTML or CSS files in this project.
